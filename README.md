# Exam Project - README
This is the final project in course "22100 - R for Bio Data Science" by group 11 
Authors: Freja Dahl Hede, Maika Jensen, Malene Nørregaard, Sofie Rossen, Sofie Theisen Honoré

The project is an explorative data analysis based on material from the paper: 

Assessment of the influence of intrinsic environmental and geographical factors on the bacterial ecology of pit latrines.

The raw data can be accessed [here](http://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/bioinformatics/ecological.html) and consists of latrine samples from Vietnam and Tanzania, along with environmental factors and bacterial content. 

## The project includes:
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Initial Explorative Analysis with e.g. violin plots, correlation analysis and heatmap 
- Principal Component Analysis
- KMeans Analysis
- A Comparative Analysis with a t-test on the OTU Counts between Tanzania and Vietnam, an examination of the correlation between certain bacteria
and environmental factors and examples of distributions
