# Exam Project - README
This is the final project in course "22100 - R for Bio Data Science" by group 11 
Authors: Freja Dahl Hede, Maika Jensen, Malene Nørregaard, Sofie Rossen, Sofie Theisen Honoré

The project is an explorative data analysis based on material from the paper: 

Assessment of the influence of intrinsic environmental and geographical factors on the bacterial ecology of pit latrines.

The raw data can be accessed [here](http://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/bioinformatics/ecological.html) and consists of latrine samples from Vietnam and Tanzania, along with environmental factors and bacterial content. 

In this project, we assess the problem:
Do we see a difference in the types of bacteria between the samples from Tanzania and Vietnam, and which factors might contribute to these differences?


## The project includes:
- Data wrangling 
- Distributions and correlations of various variables including pH, Temperature etc. between the two countries
- Principal Component Analysis
